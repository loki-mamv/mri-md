Options include: mild sedation prescribed by your doctor, open MRI machines, wide-bore MRI scanners, listening to music during the scan, keeping eyes closed, using relaxation techniques, and having a support person in the room. Tell your doctor about anxiety beforehand so accommodations can be arranged."

However, MRI is typically avoided in the first trimester unless essential, and gadolinium contrast is avoided throughout pregnancy unless absolutely necessary. Always inform staff if you're pregnant or might be."

Your cardiologist must verify your device's compatibility and may need to adjust settings before and after the scan. Bring your device card to your appointment."

It's different from CT contrast (iodine-based) and has fewer allergic reactions. The contrast is eliminated through the kidneys within 24 hours."

                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I eat before my MRI?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>For most MRI scans (brain, spine, joints, extremities), you can eat and drink normally before the exam.</p>
                    <p>For <strong>abdominal or pelvic MRI</strong>, you may need to fast for 4-6 hours beforehand. Follow the specific instructions provided by your imaging center.</p>
                    <p>If receiving contrast, drink plenty of water before and after to help flush it from your system.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What should I wear to my MRI?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes without metal:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sweatpants or yoga pants (no zippers or metal buttons)</li>
                        <li>T-shirt or sweatshirt (no metallic print)</li>
                        <li>Sports bra (no underwire) or no bra</li>
                        <li>Slip-on shoes for easy removal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your clothes contain metal, you'll be given a gown to wear. Many patients prefer to wear a gown regardless for simplicity.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need to remove my jewelry?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>Yes, all jewelry must be removed</strong> — rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, watches, and body piercings. The magnetic field can pull on metal and cause injury, or create artifacts that affect image quality.</p>
                    <p>It's best to leave valuable jewelry at home. The imaging center will provide a locker for your belongings.</p>

            <h2>Claustrophobia & Anxiety</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I have an MRI if I'm claustrophobic?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes! Claustrophobia affects 5-10% of MRI patients, and there are many effective strategies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mild sedation:</strong> Your doctor can prescribe medication (like lorazepam) to take before the scan</li>
                        <li><strong>Open MRI:</strong> Less confining machines with open sides</li>
                        <li><strong>Wide-bore MRI:</strong> Larger opening (70cm) than standard machines</li>
                        <li><strong>Music/headphones:</strong> Listening to your favorite music helps many patients</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep eyes closed:</strong> Most patients find this significantly reduces anxiety</li>
                        <li><strong>Feet-first positioning:</strong> For many scans, your head can stay outside or at the edge of the machine</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Tell your doctor about your anxiety beforehand so they can help arrange accommodations.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can someone stay in the room with me?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, in most cases a support person can stay in the MRI room with you. They must complete the same metal screening questionnaire and remove all metal objects. They won't be able to touch or speak to you during sequences, but their presence can be very comforting.</p>
                    <p>Ask about this option when scheduling your appointment.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What if I panic during the scan?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You'll be given a squeeze ball or button that alerts the technologist immediately. You can also simply speak — they can hear you through the intercom at all times.</p>
                    <p>The scan can be paused or stopped anytime. The technologist can slide you out of the scanner for a break. Remember: the machine is open at both ends, and you're never trapped.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Why is the MRI so loud?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The loud knocking, buzzing, and thumping sounds (up to 100 decibels, like a loud concert) are completely normal. They're caused by electrical currents passing through gradient coils, which vibrate against the powerful magnet.</p>
                    <p>Different imaging sequences produce different sound patterns — some sound like rapid tapping, others like a continuous hum. You'll be given earplugs or headphones to protect your hearing, and many facilities can play music during the scan.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Will I feel anything during the MRI?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most patients don't feel anything unusual. You might notice:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A slight warming sensation in the area being scanned (normal and temporary)</li>
                        <li>Cool air flowing through the scanner</li>
                        <li>A cool sensation when contrast is injected (if used)</li>
                        <li>A slight metallic taste briefly after contrast injection (rare)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The MRI itself is painless. The main challenge is staying still for the duration of the scan.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why do I have to stay so still?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>MRI creates images by detecting tiny signals from your body. Even small movements can blur the images, similar to taking a photo with a shaky camera. If images are blurry, sequences must be repeated, extending your scan time.</p>
                    <p>Each sequence lasts 2-8 minutes. You can relax between sequences when the machine goes quiet. The technologist will let you know when each sequence starts and when it's okay to move slightly.</p>

            <h2>Contrast & Safety</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is MRI with contrast?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>MRI contrast involves injecting a gadolinium-based agent through an IV. It helps radiologists see certain structures more clearly, particularly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tumors and their borders</li>
                        <li>Areas of inflammation</li>
                        <li>Blood vessels</li>
                        <li>Infection</li>
                        <li>Scar tissue vs. recurrent disease</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>MRI contrast is different from CT contrast (which uses iodine). If you've had a reaction to CT contrast, you may still safely receive MRI contrast.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Is MRI contrast safe?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Gadolinium contrast is generally very safe. Allergic reactions occur in about 0.5-2% of patients (much lower than CT contrast) and are usually mild (nausea, headache, injection site irritation).</p>
                    <p><strong>Important exceptions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Patients with severe kidney disease (GFR &lt;30) should generally avoid gadolinium due to risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis</li>
                        <li>Pregnancy: Gadolinium is avoided unless absolutely necessary</li>
                        <li>Previous reaction: Inform staff if you've reacted to MRI contrast before</li>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I have an MRI with a pacemaker?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Many pacemakers implanted since 2010 are MRI-conditional, meaning they're safe under specific conditions. Your cardiologist must verify your device's compatibility and may need to adjust settings before and after the scan.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Bring your pacemaker/ICD identification card to your appointment. The imaging team will verify compatibility before proceeding. Older pacemakers may not be MRI-compatible.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Is MRI safe during pregnancy?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>MRI is generally considered safe during pregnancy because it doesn't use ionizing radiation. However:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First trimester MRI is typically avoided unless medically necessary</li>
                        <li>Gadolinium contrast is avoided throughout pregnancy unless essential</li>
                        <li>Always inform staff if you're pregnant or might be</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your doctor will weigh the benefits of the scan against any theoretical risks for your specific situation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Dental fillings, crowns, bridges, and implants are safe in MRI. They may cause some local image distortion if scanning the head/jaw area, but they are not dangerous and won't be pulled out by the magnet.</p>
